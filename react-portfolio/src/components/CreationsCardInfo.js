A one-click shuffle button provides the user with a random drink or food recipe. If they want a specific kind of drink, the user can pick a liquor type from the drop-down value and click choose a drink. The generator will provide them with a drink based on what type of alcohol they select.The main problem we wanted to solve was to give people more choices when making drinks or food. Instead of the same boring beverages and recipes, we wanted to provide the user with various options. That way, they can try new drinks and dishes enjoyed by themselves or with family and friends.",
