## Description

This portfolio project is built using React and deployed on GitHub Pages. It features a header with navigation, pages for About, Projects, Contact, and a footer with links to my social media profiles. The navigation allows users to switch between different pages of the portfolio without reloading the page.

In the About section, users can learn more about me as a web developer. They'll see a recent photo or avatar of me and a short bio describing my experience and interests in web development.

In the Projects section, users can view titled images of six of my applications, each with a link to the deployed application and a link to the corresponding GitHub repository.

In the Contact section, users can fill out a form to get in touch with me. The form includes fields for their name, email address, and message. If the user attempts to submit the form without entering information into one or more required fields, they'll receive a notification prompting them to fill out the missing fields.

In the Resume section, users can view a list of my proficiencies and download my resume.

The site is designed with a mobile-first approach and features a custom color palette and typography that's easy on the eyes. The use of animations and React component libraries adds an extra layer of interactivity and engagement for potential employers and collaborators.

Thanks for checking out my portfolio!
